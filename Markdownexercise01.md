## **Introduction**
<!-- Horizontal Rule -->

One of the most important skills any computing graduate needs to develop is the ability to *learn things independently*. Because our field changes so rapidly, much of what you will need or want to work in the future doesn't exist yet, and so you can't learn it while you are at university.
The skills required to learn something on your own though change much more slowly. Some of them have been the same for hundreds of years - some of them are internet skills and are more recent. You will be introduced to some of these skills and be asked to apply them to learn things on your own in INFO1111.
This recognition of the need to `learn to learn`
has been around for a while now:

(this quote may explain some of those advertisements the university is so fond of putting up around campus and its website)

## **Suggested Approach**
<!-- Horizontal Rule -->

Here is a basic suggested path for you to take (this same initial process applies to pretty much everything you might want to self-learn):


<!-- Task Lists -->

* [x] First, find out what Markdown is
* [ ] Find some resources that explain how to use Markdown
* [ ] Experiment with and explore Markdown on your own
* [ ] Try and recreate this document as precisely as you can

This task is a 'trial run' before you get <!-- Strikethrough -->~~thrown into the deep end~~ asked to learn something on your own without much support from teaching staff. To be clear - you will get as much support as we can possibly offer to do with *how to learn* - but you will be almost entirely on your own in terms of the thing you are learning. While this Markdown task is not assessed, and could be completed in a couple of hours, you will soon be asked to develop a plan for learning something more substantial. Use this task to practice finding and studying resources on your own before the real thing!

As a suggestion, create a resource list. This list will help you in a few ways:

<!-- UL -->
* Keeping track of resources you have found so you don't lose track of them while you search for other resources.
* Helping you to create a bibliography and reference list when you write up your work (you don't need to do this for this markdown task, but you **do** for your main self-learning report).
* When someone asks you in a few months or years how to do something you have learned, you have resources to direct them to.

You can store this is a few ways - from something as informal as folder of bookmarks in your browser, to a list you save in Dropbox/Onedrive/

<!-- OL -->
1. First resource
1. Second resource

...

10. Tenth resource and so on


or you could use a table in Excel or similar:

<!-- Tables -->

|**Resource**                      | **Notes**              |
|----------------------------------|------------------------|
|www.okwebsite.com/info.html|Has some basic information on what to use X for but not a lot of detail about how to use it|
|www.betterwebsite.com/tutorial.asp|Has an in-depth tutorial on using X|
|www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ|Has a worked solution on video|




## **Submission**
<!-- Horizontal Ruler -->

---

Once you are ready, upload your document **as a pdf** to the <!-- Links -->[submission link on Canvas](https://canvas.sydney.edu.au/courses/30098/assignments/283513). Remember that this is not assessed - this is just so your tutor can see where you are up to if you have any questions (remember they won't tell you anything at all about Markdown itself - just how to find out about it on  your own).


Make sure you try this on your own! Having a friend teach you what they have learned isn't going to help you with the skills we are actually assessing you on.
